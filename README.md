**Fashion-MNIST Data Visualization and Training Curves Using TensorFlow**

Part of **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** ‚Äî ‚ÄúNeural Networks and TensorFlow‚Äù
This project demonstrates how to visualize Fashion-MNIST images and monitor simulated CNN training progress. It covers key machine learning concepts such as **dataset preprocessing, image visualization, and model performance tracking.**

**üöÄ Project Overview:**
The project is divided into two main tasks, each highlighting a specific aspect of machine learning:

Task 1: **Fashion-MNIST Image Display**
Loads the Fashion-MNIST dataset (training and validation images).
Normalizes pixel values from 0‚Äì255 to 0‚Äì1 for TensorFlow compatibility.
Adds channel dimension and converts the data into TensorFlow datasets.
Uses a custom function to display the first three images in grayscale, side by side.

Task 2: **Training Curves Visualization**
Simulates training progress over 10 epochs.
Generates decreasing loss values and increasing accuracy values to mimic model learning.
Plots both metrics on a single graph using dual y-axes.
Saves the graph as a PNG image to track model performance visually.

**‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:**
**TensorFlow** ‚Äì for dataset handling and preprocessing
**NumPy, Matplotlib** ‚Äì for data manipulation and visualization

**üí° This Project Demonstrates:**
How to preprocess and visualize image datasets in TensorFlow.
How to simulate and visualize model training progress.
The importance of data visualization in understanding machine learning workflows.
A clean and reproducible project structure for easy experimentation.
